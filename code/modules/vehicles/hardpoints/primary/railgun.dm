Using a high-efficiency hypergolic propellant as the first stage, which is then accelerated to blistering velocities by the magentic rails. Thanks to excessive energy requirements, the turret internals were significantly remodelled to account for the capacitors and dedicated generator. Suffers from wear-through issues on barrels, and heat-masking."
