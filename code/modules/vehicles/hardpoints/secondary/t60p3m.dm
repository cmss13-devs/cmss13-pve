This Russo-Polish developed machinegun features robust autonomous fire capability, and was commonly used to intercept low-threat projectiles, though thanks to the superior active and passive systems in most vehicles, tankists now prefer to simply fire it at infantry and soft targets instead. Known for an annoying tendency for drifting off target in certain high temperature environments."
