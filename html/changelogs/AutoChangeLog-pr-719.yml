  - qol: "M5 RPG now has built-in limited view-boost miniscope"
  - qol: "Type 71's GL module now uses the underbarrel slot, so the whiners can wheesht"
  - qol: "WP smoke and normal smoke have differing shades"
  - qol: "The M51A BFAB now 'detonates' on impact, giving a message about it jumping into the air before actually exploding"
  - balance: "M5 RPG rockets adjusted in damage values & effect on target"
  - balance: "UPP 40mm grenade rounds adjusted to make their single-shot nature worthwhile"
  - balance: "M108 grenades are now viable to use in combat, rather than being purely utility"
  - balance: "The M51A BFAB grenades have recieved tweaks to their damage to make them feel better to use. They still have a one second delay upon impact before detonation, so lead your shots well! Adjusted so hAI shouldn't be able to throw them back once they hit a tile too."
  - balance: "Halve the range of the SADAR, so as to not result in some poor player being gibbed from 3 screens away from the firer should they miss their initial target"
  - maptweak: "The garrow now has a box of starshell grenades in the armory, and one of the smoke grenade boxes in the cargo bay is swapped for a coloured smoke subtype"
