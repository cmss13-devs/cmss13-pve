You can link plasteel barricades together using a crowbar. First click one, and then click one adjacent. Repeat as needed.
A lone marine is a dead marine and a happy xeno. Stick together!
Watch out for friendly fire. Make sure you're not walking into anyone's firing line, and make sure no one else is in yours!
Be mindful when using hand grenades. Getting stunned or knocked over after priming a grenade will drop it at your feet. This is obviously very dangerous for not only you, but your friends as well.
Reflective walls will bounce back non-IFF bullets, including rockets. Try not to shoot them.
Vary your loadout! Doing the same thing every round gets old fast. Try out the pistols, or carry flares.
Be careful when firing an Orbital Bombardment, Close Air Support, or the Mortar. Make sure you're not about to blow up the entire marine push.
The Orbital Bombardment is always closer than it looks.
Never inject a marine you haven't scanned! You might overdose them; ESPECIALLY so with an emergency autoinjector.
Check dead marines (skull icon on medhud) for useful gear, such as webbings, AP ammo, or binoculars.

More dakka is not good when it is directed towards your teammates.
Never place barricades facing each other - Not only does this block bullets, both barricades are damaged at once if one is slashed!
An FOB is as strong as its weakest part. Secure all flanks, remember that walls can be pried open.
Flamethrowers: Green fire is weak but has a lot of utility, such as melting through armor and being instantly extinguishable. Queens and Ravagers are flameproof. Most flamethrower damage comes from the initial burst, not the flame on the ground. Don't forget you have an underbarrel extinguisher.
Use CPR to keep critically wounded marines alive for a corpsman to get to them. It can be done by clicking the marine on help intent with an open hand. Make sure to get the rhythm correct!

Blood loss can lead to hunger, which can slow you down. Make sure you're always full after taking a beating.
Resin structures are weaker to melee than they are to bullets. Take out your knives!
When fighting xenomorphs, don't aim for the head - It won't increase damage against anyone but your fellow marines.
Scavenging attachments (or other things) from dead marines isn't bad practice, as long as you make sure they're actually dead first.
When receiving a supply crate drop, make sure to move the crate before opening it - Otherwise subsequent supply crates will be hidden beneath it!
If a grenade comes your way, hit the deck! Lying down will reduce damage and let you dodge any shrapnel flying overhead.

For Vehicle Crewmen : it is often safer to repair the parts of your APC or tank inside the vehicle than outside it.

To check your skills, go to the IC tab and click "view skills".
Minirockets pack the most punch per cost as far as CAS weaponry is concerned.
The U7 underbarrel shotgun can instantly break down both resin doors and mechanical airlocks, and it's not bad at breaking walls down either.
You can find breaching charges in Requisitions or the Squad Engineer vendor. They function like C4, but can be deployed and explode much quicker, and release powerful shrapnel on the opposite side. They require minor engineering knowledge, which can be obtained from pamphlets.
Armor piercing ammunition does less damage to unarmored targets.
You can insert empty pill bottles into ChemMasters before creating pills to have them automatically inserted.

You can click on your Security Access Tuner (multitool) in your hand to locate the area's APC if there is one.
Need help learning the game and these tips aren't enough? Use MentorHelp.
Clicking on your sprite with help intent will let you check your body, seeing where your fractures and other wounds are.
Armor has insulative properties - taking it off will help you cool off and take less damage faster if you've been set on fire.
Both foldable cades & plasteel cades if loosened and folded down can be transported in crates! In this way, you can use the crate as a portable breach-repair kit, or dragged (or carried via Power Loader) to an unsecure area for quick defensive set up.
The fuel tank pouch doesn't just carry fuel for an incinerator- they can also carry full-size extinguishers. Toolbelts & tool pouches also may hold miniature extinguishers.

If you jump out of a dropship with a parachute on (when there is no paradrop system active), you will land at a random location on the map.
If you push crates out of a dropship when paradropping, it will land near the paradrop drop point.
When paradropping, you can toss any large item (such as a backpack, pouch, or gun) into hyperspace, and it will land near the paradrop drop point. However, smaller items such as flares will not survive the fall.
