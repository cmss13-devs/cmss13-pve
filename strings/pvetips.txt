In the USCM, every marine is a specially trained technician capable of performing repairs and maintenance on various USCM equipment, from vehicles to rifles to blast doors.
A desperate attempt at surviving in the modern age, the formation of the UPP came directly as a result of the European Union's prior dissolution, spurred by mass famine, a collapse of societal structures, and a general abandonment of support and relations from the recently formed United Americas and Three World Empire.
The Service or Jail Act is a legislation in the United Americas that permits incarcerated individuals to enlist in the USCM to avoid jail time provided they are capable of meeting the strict requirements of service.
USCM Platoons on the Golden Arrow are formed by 11 marines—two squads of four, a corpsman, a platoon sergeant, and the platoon's commanding officer. Squads are split into two teams, a gun team comprised of a rifleman and a smartgunner, and a rifle team consisting of the squad leader and a rifleman.
Weyland-Yutani and the Three World Empire have close relations, with the exception of the Royal Marine Commandos, the TWE's primary military force is backed up by Weyland-Yutani's private military contractors.
Despite popular belief, the USCM and UPP are not in a proper war. Over the centuries, what will and won't cause all-out war has shifted. Skirmishes in the outer fringes of space between the UPP and the United Americas are frequent and the use of nuclear weapons is almost as common as missile attacks were in the 21st century.
The USCM operates on a fast response doctrine, patrolling the outer reaches of the territories of the United Americas and ready to deploy at a moment's notice.
Typical operations for the marines in the USCM involve handling minor things for the outer colonies. If a colony stops sending all clear signals, a ship is tasked to investigate. More often than not it is a transmitter or relay satellite that was disabled for one reason or another, though they do frequently respond to civil riots and quell worker strikes on colonies where the CMB, if even present, are incapable of handling the situation.
The Office of the Colonial Marshals, otherwise known as the OCM and frequently referred to as the CMB is a law enforcement agency responsible for policing colonial centers and space stations. Often colonies are too small to even warrant a presence of the Colonial Marshals and simply rely on self policing. If the CMB can't handle something or aren't present, it's up to the USCM to deal with the problem.
The M577 APC is the most lightly armored vehicle in the USCM arsenal and operates as a mobile command center for a marine platoon, though due to it's fragile nature marines tend to frown upon it's use in the field.
Capable of a max speed of Mach 8, the UD-4 "Cheyenne" Dropship is a combat utility spacecraft used by the USCM. Though not built to enage in significant with ground or space defenses, the UD-4 is capable of withstanding a significant beating while still remaining airborne. Despite this, even light damage can prevent it from exiting the atmosphere of a planet.
Excluding the Commanding Officer and synthetic support units, most USCM vessels only carry combat personnel aboard. Any supply, engineering, or medical duties are carried out by the marines themselves. Repairs too complex for marines are carried out by synthetics, with surgeries being handled by an autodoc suite. Occasionally a vessel may employ additional support staff in the form of doctors, engineers, and requisitions personnel, though this is uncommon.
Military Police are not a frequently present force aboard marine ships, with the bulk of disciplinary action being carried out by the NCOs of the vessel.
USCM FTL is highly dangerous, utilizing a tachyon shunt to get from one destination to the other, speeding up time in the ship itself. Anyone not in hypersleep is, for lack of a better description, is forced into a tachyonic state, undergoing psychosis and rapid aging before quicky succumbing to the effects. Synthetics, however, are still capable of operating while a tachyon shunt is underway. Even with this process, the fastest vessels often take several days or even weeks to reach their destinations.
With the National Security Act of 2101, the USCM and Weyland-Yutani, among other corporations, have a close relationship. As such, the USCM may be activated as a short term security force in mutual corporate interests.
Launched from drydock less than a year prior, the destruction of the original Bougainville-class Golden Arrow in June 2182 put the United Americas PR department in a mad scrmable to save the reputation of the Bougainville class as a whole, having only been put into service January 2182. Officially, the Golden Arrow is listed as a Bougainville on all official records despite it's class actually being a Conestoga, and as such being much larger than official records state. This quick response has led to there being several hour long delays in docking due to not having an unoccupied dock capable of fitting the sheer size of a Conestoga.
The United Americas Allied Command (UAAC) is the overarching joint command of all United American militaries—all United States, Latin America, and Canadian armed forces are under it— and as estabilished by the Washington Treaty, it is tasked with maintaining the collective security of all UA signatories and their recognized interstellar colonies. The UAAC is formed by the United States Army, United States AeroSpace Force (USASF), Latin American Colonial Navy (LACN), Canadian Colonial Armed Forces (CCAF), United Americas Outer Rim Defense (UAORD) and of course, the United States Colonial Marine Corps (USCM)
Remember to interact with your comrades before you drop, play games, talk about your lives. You'll never know if you'll ever get to see them after the mission is done.
